# ToDoQuadrant
This project is a WPF-based ToDo List application featuring a quadrant layout for organizing tasks into four categories: Work, Business, Personal, and Education. Users can add tasks to any quadrant, drag and drop tasks between quadrants, and all ToDo items are persisted in a local JSON file for automatic loading and saving
